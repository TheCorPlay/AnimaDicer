## CONCEPTUAL IDEA
	
	The purpouse of this project is to make the rol games faster.
	This project is specifically focused on the role play Anima.
	
	It is an especially complex and slow roll game in terms of dice and calculations,
	for this reason we have decided to create a program that makes dice rolls faster,
	allowing both players and the master to focus on the immersion in this world.
